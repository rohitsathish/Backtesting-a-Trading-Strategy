# Backtesting-a-Trading-Strategy

In this project, I built a fairly realistic backtester that uses Barra data. The backtester performs portfolio optimization that includes transaction costs, and I've implemented it with computational efficiency in mind, to allow for a reasonably fast backtest. I've also used performance attribution to identify the major drivers of the portfolio's profit-and-loss (PnL).
